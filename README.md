This extension adds YAML snippets for **all** [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification-resources-and-properties.html) into Visual Studio Code.

> [!TIP]
> **Towards the Cloud runs the AWS foundation for modern product teams. This means your team ships faster, slashes AWS spend, and stay audit-ready without having to hire a platform squad.**
>
> Unsure where to start? Book a free AWS Account Review. We’ll analyse your AWS environment, hand you a security & cost report, and you decide whether to act on it yourself or have us execute. No pressure, no retainer required up front.

>
> ### The problem: AWS complexity compounds fast
>
> Ad‑hoc builds become 40–60% overspend, unmonitored security gaps put customer data at risk, and engineers burn out running infrastructure instead of shipping products.
>
> ### Our managed foundation keeps you moving forward
>
> - ✅ **Compliant Landing Zone** – [Multi-account AWS CDK deployment](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone) with 100% [CIS benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) coverage,
> centralized logging, and SSO-ready access control.
> - ✅ **Production-ready CDK components** – Pre-hardened building blocks so teams launch new services without reinventing best practices.
> - ✅ **CI/CD with safe rollbacks** – GitOps workflows and governed pipelines that let you release faster with confidence.
> - ✅ **Quarterly cost & security reviews** – [Cost Optimisation](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) plus [Security Reviews](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review)
> delivered proactively.
> - ✅ **Fractional Cloud Engineer** – On-demand expertise from an architect who implemented enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure for over a decade.
>
> ### Outcomes our customers see
>
> - **30%+ lower AWS bill** – Continuous oversight prevents expensive drift ([30–60% documented savings](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study)).
> - **SOC 2 / HIPAA acceleration** – Guardrails, logging, and evidence packs ready on day one.
> - **Audit-ready every quarter** – Automated monitoring plus recurring reviews keep findings under control.
> - **Faster product velocity** – Engineers build features, not managing infrastructure.
> - **Headcount leverage** – A [flexible retainer](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) replaces the cost of a full-time platform team.
>
> **Proof:** Y Combinator startup Accolade used our Landing Zone to [earn SOC 2 in record time](https://towardsthecloud.com/blog/aws-landing-zone-case-study-accolade):

## Features

1. Adds support for the following SAM resource types:

```YAML
    AWS::Serverless::Api
    AWS::Serverless::Application
    AWS::Serverless::Connector
    AWS::Serverless::Function
    AWS::Serverless::GraphQLApi
    AWS::Serverless::HttpApi
    AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion
    AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
    AWS::Serverless::StateMachine
```

2. Includes intrinsic functions, conditions, and a variety of parameter types.
3. Utilizes placeholders for quick navigation within the properties of each resource.
4. Provides documentation links for each resource.
5. Available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dannysteenman/sam-snippets) for Gitpod support.

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install this extension
* **Step 2.** create a `.yml` file to start working on your AWS SAM project.
* **Step 3.** Check in the bottom right-hand corner of the VS Code editor that the file type is listed as "YAML".
* **Step 4.** To start with the basic template structure, type `sam` to get the YAML formatted template fragment.
* **Step 5.** Start adding resources in the resource section by using their prefix name e.g. ```serverless-api``` equals resource type ```AWS::Serverless::Api```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 5), the corresponding snippet will show up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 5).
