## Features

1. Adds support for the following SAM resource types:

```YAML
    AWS::Serverless::Api
    AWS::Serverless::Application
    AWS::Serverless::Connector
    AWS::Serverless::Function
    AWS::Serverless::GraphQLApi
    AWS::Serverless::HttpApi
    AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion
    AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
    AWS::Serverless::StateMachine
```

2. Includes intrinsic functions, conditions, and a variety of parameter types.
3. Utilizes placeholders for quick navigation within the properties of each resource.
4. Provides documentation links for each resource.
5. Available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dannysteenman/sam-snippets) for Gitpod support.

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install this extension
* **Step 2.** create a `.yml` file to start working on your AWS SAM project.
* **Step 3.** Check in the bottom right-hand corner of the VS Code editor that the file type is listed as "YAML".
* **Step 4.** To start with the basic template structure, type `sam` to get the YAML formatted template fragment.
* **Step 5.** Start adding resources in the resource section by using their prefix name e.g. ```serverless-api``` equals resource type ```AWS::Serverless::Api```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 5), the corresponding snippet will show up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 5).
